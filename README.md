Climate Change Survey Data Analysis with Machine Learning  
==================================================================

1. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------
To run the analysis from start to finish, follow these steps:

1.1. Download and extract the ZIP archive containing this project.
1.2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed (preferably via Anaconda or a virtual environment).
1.3. Open the provided Google Colab notebook (link inside the file: `Colab_Link.txt`) **OR** run `main_analysis.ipynb` locally.
1.4. (Optional) Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
1.5. Execute the notebook cells in order. The notebook handles:
    - Data loading and cleaning
    - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - Correlation analysis
    - Regression modeling (linear & logistic)
    - Model evaluation
    - Visualization of results

2. DEPENDENCIES
---------------
This project depends on the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- scipy
- notebook or Jupyter Lab (if running locally)

Install all dependencies using the command:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

3. EXPECTED OUTPUTS

---

Running the analysis will generate:

* Summary statistics and correlation matrices
* Linear regression results (e.g., prediction of climate concern score)
* Logistic regression output (e.g., predicting support for climate policy)
* Visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots, regression lines)
* Model evaluation metrics such as R², accuracy, precision/recall
* Interpretation and commentary on the findings (in notebook markdown cells)

4. DOCUMENTATION OF FILES

---

Here's what each file in the project does:

* `README.txt` – This file; explains how to use the project.
* `survey_data.csv` – The cleaned dataset used for analysis.
* `main_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter/Colab notebook with all code and explanations.
* `requirements.txt` – List of Python packages required.
* `Colab_Link.txt` – Direct link to open the notebook in Google Colab.
* `models/` (folder, optional) – If included, contains saved ML models.
* `figures/` (folder, optional) – Stores generated plots and visualizations.
* `notes.txt` (optional) – Any relevant notes or assumptions made during the project.
