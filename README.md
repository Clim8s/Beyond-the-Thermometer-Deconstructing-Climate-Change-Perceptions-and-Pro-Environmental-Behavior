# Climate Change Survey Data Analysis with Machine Learning

---

## 1. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

To run the analysis from start to finish, follow these steps:

1. **Download and extract** the ZIP archive containing this project.  
2. Ensure you have **Python 3.8 or above** installed (preferably via Anaconda or a virtual environment).  
3. Open the provided Google Colab notebook (link inside `Colab_Link.txt`) **OR** run `main_analysis.ipynb` locally.  
4. *(Optional)* Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
5. Execute the notebook cells in order. The notebook handles:
   - Data loading and cleaning  
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Regression modeling (linear & logistic)  
   - Model evaluation  
   - Visualization of results

## 2. DEPENDENCIES

This project depends on the following Python libraries:

- pandas==2.2.2  
- numpy==1.26.4  
- matplotlib==3.8.4  
- seaborn==0.13.2  
- scikit-learn==1.4.2  

These are listed in the file: `requirements.txt`

### â–¶ LOCAL INSTALLATION (recommended via virtual environment):

**Step 1**: Create and activate a virtual environment  
- *Windows*:
```bash
python -m venv venv  
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- *macOS/Linux*:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 2**: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### â–¶ GOOGLE COLAB:

These libraries are usually pre-installed.  
If needed, run this in a Colab cell:
```python
!pip install pandas==2.2.2 numpy==1.26.4 matplotlib==3.8.4 seaborn==0.13.2 scikit-learn==1.4.2
```

## 3. EXPECTED OUTPUTS

Running the analysis will generate:

- Summary statistics and correlation matrices  
- Linear regression results (e.g., prediction of climate concern score)  
- Logistic regression output (e.g., predicting support for climate policy)  
- Visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots, regression lines)  
- Model evaluation metrics such as RÂ², accuracy, precision/recall  
- Interpretation and commentary on the findings (in notebook markdown cells)
