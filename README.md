# Climate Change Survey Data Analysis with Machine Learning

---

## 1. STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

To run the analysis from start to finish, follow these steps:

1. **Download and extract** the ZIP archive containing this project.  
2. Ensure you have **Python 3.8 or above** installed (preferably via Anaconda or a virtual environment).  
3. Open the provided Google Colab notebook (link inside the file: `Colab_Link.txt`) **OR** run `main_analysis.ipynb` locally.  
4. *(Optional)* Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
5. Execute the notebook cells in order. The notebook handles:  
   - Data loading and cleaning  
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Regression modeling (linear & logistic)  
   - Model evaluation  
   - Visualization of results

## 2. DEPENDENCIES

This project depends on the following Python libraries:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- statsmodels  
- scipy  
- notebook or Jupyter Lab (if running locally)

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. EXPECTED OUTPUTS

Running the analysis will generate:

- Summary statistics and correlation matrices  
- Linear regression results (e.g., prediction of climate concern score)  
- Logistic regression output (e.g., predicting support for climate policy)  
- Visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots, regression lines)  
- Model evaluation metrics such as RÂ², accuracy, precision/recall  
- Interpretation and commentary on the findings (in notebook markdown cells)
